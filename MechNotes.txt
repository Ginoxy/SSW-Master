Misc
Ti ts'ang "China Doll" - Little Early for IJJs...fluffed as experimental?
OWR-2M - RS is underweight, used armor from Sourcebook section to match BV.
DV-1S Dervish - RS has an extra assigned HS it doesn't need.
PUL-2V - BV Mismatch due to armor; RS has an extra point of armor (15.5 x 1.12 x 16 = 277.76, round down to 277). Removed point from rear CT. MM's armor placement seems off on the torsos completely.
RPT-2X Raptor II - BV Mismatch, sheet mismatch...replaced the BAP with ECM. Keep eye out.
RCL-4 Dig Lord - BV mismatch
RCL-4M Dig Lord - BV Mismatch
CTF-5MOC Cataphract "Naomi" - Date is little screwy, Plasma Rifle not introduced till 3068
DGR-6FC2 Dragon Fire "Kishi" - RS is missing the TSM. Added 3 to each arm to make the BV work properly.
FNR-4A Fafnir "Peter" - LA odd, missing an endosteel crit
Jenner Samuli - Reduced Front CT armor by 1
Bandersnatch Horus - BV mismatch; SSW and MM Agree.
Emperor Nerran - BV Mismatch; SSW and MM Agree
All ProspectorMechs from HBMPS don't have BVs. Oddly, name changes as well.

"Rock Otter" - Dropped RA hand actuator for Mining Drill. No need to assign heat sink.
"Rock Possum" - No need to assign heat sink, Dropped RA hand actuator. Mech Data says Cargo Bay is on the LT, crits show it on RT.
"Space Hound" - missing fuell used 2 1 ton cargo bays instead
Morpheus L'Morte II - Couldn't fit the spikes based on the Record Sheet, made the armor FF to add the spikes.


MWDA
AgroMech MOD - 1 ton overweight. Reduced armor by 1 ton. Used PRI HMP files ( http://www.pryderockindustries.com/downloads/featured/hmp_rs_da_mechs.zip ) for armor values.
ForestryMech MOD - 1 ton overweight. See AgroMech MOD notes.
MiningMech - 3.5 tonsOverweight - RS uses standard IS. Too much of a change to make a worthwhile RS
MiningMech MOD - Overweight - RS uses standard IS. Too much of a change to make a worthwhile RS.
Cougar X - Had to be mixed tech to get the Composite structure
Cougar X2 - Had to be mixed tech to get the Composite Structure, FF armor rounding error, reduced rear ct by 1

Omni
Naga - BV mismatch most likely due to pre-errata Arrow IV BV
Balius A Weapons reversed from TRO went with TRO.
Balius D reverses weapons, followed TRO
Malak Caelestis - BV mismatch...capacitor maybe?
Deva Eminus - ERMLs are in the RA instead of RT..moved to RT to match TRO.
Black Hawk-KU Albert Benton..same guy, no RS in Sword and Dragon.
Gargoyle H- RS shows ammo in RA, RS shows in RT. Currently in RA.
Stooping Hawk - Missing dates for Prime, A, B, C, D, E

KIC-3 - No Data
XV Powerman - No Data
XVI Powerman - followed TR, no weight for extra cargo.
Buster Class - Removed BC from name
ED-X4 - TRVA Gryo is incorrect, reduced armor by 1 ton to compensate. Also, writeup says "Commercial Light" TR section says "Industrial" Lifthoist can't fit in CT, moved to RA for the heck of it (maybe rear torso instead?)

CON-7 "Carbine" ConstructionMech - Armor is 32 points, 36 are assigned.
MR-8C Marco - Design is 1.5 tons overweight (forgot JumpJet weight). Design should have 10 Heatsinks (Fusion Engine). Reduced armor to 2.5 tons to allow for the Op:K model's weaponry. 
Pompier FireMech - moved Liquid Cargo to RT (otherwise it would be 3 crits in the CT). Fuel Cell nets you one heat sink automatically.

Sword and Dragon
DRG-7K "Mark" BV Mismatch (BV seems based on incorrect MM file)
JR-7K "Grace II" - Removed point of rear CT armor to fix.
TBT-5K - Pretty Sure this has been replaced by the 7K

XTRComStar
Grim Reaper should have a Clan 280XL engine (set at 275, due to lack of Frankenstein rules)

GRF-2N-X Griffin - Can't do yet, no Prototype IJJs
MAD-4X Marauder - Can't do yet, stupid Freezers, Primitive Endo Steel

Wars of Reaving Supplemental - All dates set to 3072
pg. 53 Cephalus Prime - Light TAG is listed in the RT in the "Weapons & Equipment Inventory" section, but on the Critical Hit Table, Light TAG is in the LT. According to Wars of Reaving (pg. 215) the Light TAG should be in the RT. -- Fix: move Light TAG to RT just below the XXL engine, slide the Laser AMS and Modular Armor down 1 slot to make room.
pg. 54 Cephalus A - Right and Left Torsos swapped, Weapons and Equipment list and Wars of Reaving to assign equipment locations
pg. 55 Cephalus B - Weapons and Equipment list and criticals don't match. See http://bg.battletech.com/forums/index.php/topic,18465.msg417582.html#msg417582
pg. 60 Mist Lynx (Koshi) Z - Should have double heat sinks, be Clan only (set date to 3074 for modular armor)
pg. 61 Viper (Dragonfly) Z - Weapons and Equipment lists the Laser AMS as just "Anti-Missile System" Critical hits table lists it as "Laser AMS" but provides ammo for it. Delete the Ammo, keep it as AMS.
pg. 62 Septicemia A-Z - Weapons and Equipment list and criticals don't match. Moved Light TAG to RT. Should be 16 DHS
pg. 63 Septicemia B-Z - Should be 13 DHS.
pg. 66 Septicemia E - Right and Left Torso swapped from WoR.
pg. 67 Septicemia F - Should be Advanced (only has Arrow IV on it)
pg. 68 Septicemia US - Installed the cargo as a single 2 ton item instead of 2 1 ton items.
pg. 71 Stormcrow/Ryoken Z - Nova CEWS in RT in Equipment list, head in Crit table (followed equipment list). iHMLs should be above the ammo in arms to follow convention.
pg. 72 Summoner Z - NCEWS listed in RT, in CT in Crit. Put in RT for now; iATM12 listed in RA, put LT to follow picture.
pg. 73 Timber Wolf/Mad Cat Z - NCEWS listed in RT, in CT, put in RT for now.
pg. 74 Osteon Prime - RS says Advanced, should be Experimental
pg. 75 Osteon A - RS says Advanced, should be Experimental; Delete bracket in second half RT, slots 1-3
pg. 76 Osteon B - RS says Clantech, should be Mixed Tech (Large Vibroblade)
pg. 78 Osteon D - Design is 2 tons underweight
pg. 79 Osteon E - Targeting computer is listed in the head, not enough space, followed sheet and put it in LT
pg. 80 Osteon F - Design half a ton overweight, reduced MG ammo to half a ton. Put the ERLL above the amo in the head to match standard design policy.
pg. 84 Savage Coyote Z - Nova CEWS listed in CT, no space, put in head like crit sheet says.
pg. 85 Turkina Z - SSW seems to be armoring components in spaces where previous variants had armored component (see U and Z variants). Looks like its loading them from previous version?

Total Chaos
pg. 254 AWS-10KM Awesome (Cameron) - Not in MUL, set date to 3078 (Date of Terra battles)
pg. 255 AS7-D-H Atlas II (Devlin) - Not in MUL, set date to 3078 (date of Terra battles)
