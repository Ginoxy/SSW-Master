Wars of Reaving Supplemental - All dates set to 3072
pg. 53 Cephalus Prime - Light TAG is listed in the RT in the "Weapons & Equipment Inventory" section, but on the Critical Hit Table, Light TAG is in the LT. According to Wars of Reaving (pg. 215) the Light TAG should be in the RT. -- Fix: move Light TAG to RT just below the XXL engine, slide the Laser AMS and Modular Armor down 1 slot to make room.
pg. 54 Cephalus A - Right and Left Torsos swapped, Weapons and Equipment list and Wars of Reaving to assign equipment locations
pg. 55 Cephalus B - Weapons and Equipment list and criticals don't match. See http://bg.battletech.com/forums/index.php/topic,18465.msg417582.html#msg417582

pg. 63 Septicemia B-Z - Should be 13 DHS.
pg. 66 Septicemia E - Right and Left Torso swapped from WoR.
pg. 67 Septicemia F - Should be Advanced (only has Arrow IV on it)
pg. 68 Septicemia US - Installed the cargo as a single 2 ton item instead of 2 1 ton items.

pg. 72 Summoner Z - NCEWS listed in RT, in CT in Crit. Put in RT for now; iATM12 listed in RA, put LT to follow picture.
pg. 73 Timber Wolf/Mad Cat Z - NCEWS listed in RT, in CT, put in RT for now.
pg. 74 Osteon Prime - RS says Advanced, should be Experimental
pg. 75 Osteon A - RS says Advanced, should be Experimental; Delete bracket in second half RT, slots 1-3
pg. 76 Osteon B - RS says Clantech, should be Mixed Tech (Large Vibroblade)
pg. 78 Osteon D - Design is 2 tons underweight
pg. 79 Osteon E - Targeting computer is listed in the head, not enough space, followed sheet and put it in LT
pg. 80 Osteon F - Design half a ton overweight, reduced MG ammo to half a ton. Put the ERLL above the amo in the head to match standard design policy.
pg. 84 Savage Coyote Z - Nova CEWS listed in CT, no space, put in head like crit sheet says.
pg. 85 Turkina Z - SSW seems to be armoring components in spaces where previous variants had armored component (see U and Z variants). Looks like its loading them from previous version?
