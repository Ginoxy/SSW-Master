        <overview>No other BattleMech has captured imaginations in the Inner Sphere quite like the Atlas with its skull-like visage. It is among the largest and most imposing of the BattleMechs that have shaped the fate of humanity for the past half millennium. If its destructive potential is measured by its ability to level a city block, the Atlas reigns supreme. By all accounts, it is death incarnate, the king of all BattleMechs.:br::tab:There is another aspect to the symbolism attached to the Atlas. Unlike other high-end ’Mechs, most Atlas pilots chose to stay behind when General Aleksandr Kerensky called for the Exodus of the SLDF. Many of these juggernauts survived the Succession Wars. With Operation Revival, the Atlas became particularly tied to the fate of the Inner Sphere. It was the strongest bulwark Clan forces encountered in many battles. With this change in role of greatest destructor to greatest protector, the Atlas became a symbol of Inner Sphere resistance against the Clans and their OmniMechs.</overview>
        <capabilities>There are constants in the Atlases over the centuries: a carefully crafted exterior befitting an instrument of destruction, high-end communications that make it an ideal command unit, and thick armor to support either role. Its armament invariably centers on a large ballistic weapon in the right torso. A visual quirk on most Atlases is the utilitarian coolant nozzle that mirrors the main weapon in the left torso. A hip-mounted LRM launcher is often mounted below it. The original’s quick-cycle system was never replicated in later variants. It currently houses smaller, tertiary weapons.:br::br::tab:Independence Weaponry took a long time to offer an upgrade to their Revival-era variant, which may have retained a dated heat dissipation system, but otherwise satisfied MechWarriors. The current model finally upgraded the heat sinks while also incorporating new armor and gyro options.:br::br::tab:Defiance Industries has continually produced and improved the Atlas. The Jihad and Word of Blake occupation resulted in the introduction of the Atlas II and a “mobility variant.” Three competing Atlas lines created a logistical inefficiency. The solution was to create a new variant that incorporates all the ClanTechequivalent systems Defiance offers.</capabilities>
        <battlehistory>The little known Starseeker religious community in the deserts of Lahti had a problem with raiders in the summer of 3059. The tenets of their faith forbade them from engaging in violence—even in self-defense—and from possessing money with which to hire defenders. The peaceful people were resigned to turning over their entire moonfruit crop. Thus, they were surprised when an unknown Atlas appeared from the nearby rocky highlands and lumbered into the bandits. The ’Mech bore no insignia and broadcast no identification, but the pilot fought with great skill and determination. The raiders employed ramshackle and jury-rigged equipment, but their numbers proved a significant challenge to the Atlas. The peaceful Starseekers watched raptly as the single ’Mech worked its way through the bandit ranks before finally facing off with the only two ’Mechs in the enemy force: a Locust and a Shadow Hawk. The Atlas destroyed the Locust’s engine with an autocannon shot, but the Hawk proved more dangerous. The ’Mechs scored hits on each other and despite the Atlas’ superior weaponry and mass, the battle was touch and go. The Shadow Hawk pilot made the fatal mistake of getting too close. The Atlas managed to land a punch squarely on the cockpit, crushing the bandit MechWarrior. With the fight ended, the Atlas shut down and stood motionless outside the community’s gates.:br::br::tab:By February 3137, all that remained of Bannson’s Raiders was a couple of lances led by the unknown pilot of an old Atlas. Despite the command’s poor equipment and lack of formal military training, they managed to evade Republic authorities on seven worlds before being cornered on Altair by Stone’s Lament. The battle, of course, was incredibly lopsided, but surprisingly the Raiders’ leader proved a worthy opponent. He kicked off the fight by crippling a Lament Wight with a Gauss slug to the shoulder. The Atlas was in the heart of the conflict and rapidly became a focus of the Lament’s efforts. Even so, the pilot personally accounted for six Lament ’Mechs. A Lament Malice delivered the killing blow, finally causing the Atlas to collapse. The pilot did not survive and was never identified. He was however celebrated by the Lament MechWarriors as a commendable foe.</battlehistory>

        <variants>In the 3060s, Defiance Industries quickly introduced the AS7-S3 alongside their earlier heavy Gauss rifle variant, which reverted to more conventional but powerful weaponry. Deemed exactly equal in capability, both were produced concurrently in the years since. The later AS7-4 retained the majority of the -S3’s armament, but married it to stealth armor. These were all produced alongside the Atlas II and faster models, until a recent program combined their best attributes into the -8S.:br::br::tab:The Lyrans were as eager to utilize the Atlas’s command capabilities as their Combine counterparts. The Commonwealth focused on the use of command consoles. Initial attempts upgraded the AS7-K, introduced en masse to the Federated Commonwealth while on relatively good terms with the Combine in the 3050s. The resulting -S3-DC became the main command Atlas a decade later.:br::br::tab:Independence offers an export version of their -8K, which uses a standard engine at the expense of some secondary weaponry.:br::br::tab:The Clans had few Atlases. Nevertheless, a rudimentary refit protocol was created for the Atlas C, which upgraded the weapons, and was later commonly implemented on captured Inner Sphere Atlases during Operation Revival. A more thorough upgrade that replaced the LRMs with an additional ER PPC was later implemented on most Atlases and Atlas IIs in Clan space. The few remaining chassis replaced their LRMs with Arrow IV artillery pieces. All our ArcShips can perform both upgrades on most existing Atlas chassis.</variants>
        <notables>Precentor Martial Anastasius Focht: The man born Frederick Steiner rose from the fires of his own treachery to forge a reputation both as the man who beat the Clans and who failed to stop the rise of the Word of Blake. The road to his new life as Focht began on Dromini VI in late 3029 with the Tenth Lyran Guards’ attempt to disrupt Theodore Kurita’s preparations for an assault into the Commonwealth. Forgoing his Zeus for an Atlas, Steiner led his troops in a suicidal attack on the DCMS supply base. He fought with characteristic skill, tinged with a hint of feral abandon. The disgraced commander was determined to inflict as much damage as possible before his inevitable death. Yet when it became clear that the Guards had reached the limit of their assault, Steiner nobly offered his surrender to guarantee the safe withdrawal of his people. Though Frederick Steiner died that day, Anastasius Focht took the lessons learned and became one of the Inner Sphere’s greatest leaders since the Great Father.:br:MechWarrior Liam Miguel Loyola: Once the Starseekers on Lahti worked up the courage to approach the dormant Atlas that had saved their community, they found an unconscious man in the cockpit. He was unknown to them and no identifying uniform or documentation were found. The only clue to his identity was the name Liam Miguel Loyola on his cooling vest and a silver pendant necklace with the letters “LLL” around his neck. After waking up and being treated for his injuries, the man remembered nothing. Loyola politely declined to join the Starseeker faith, though he remained near the community, knowing that the peaceful people would always need his protection.:br:Leftenant Richard West II: House West is a minor noble clan dating to the earliest settlement on New Avalon. Ardent supporters of the Davions, they have supplied the Federated Suns with countless soldiers and officers over the centuries. Richard had just posted to the Davion Heavy Guards when Katherine Steiner stripped the RCT of its transport assets, stranding the Guards on Galax until Prince Victor’s push to retake New Avalon staged from that world. West piloted an Atlas that had been in his family for two hundred years as he personally led the assault that liberated his hometown on the continent of Brunswick.:br:MechWarrior James Andreou: Andreou grew up idolizing MechWarriors as a modern knighthood. The then-Leftenant was horrified when his commanding officer in the Bremond DMM ordered him to execute several surrendered Blakist soldiers. He was arrested for refusing to follow orders but sprung that night by several comrades. The group stole their BattleMechs and fled to a rendezvous with a trader they paid to get them off-world. The group fell out over money while looking for work as mercenaries on Antallos. In the ensuing fight, Andreou’s Atlas suffered what he thought was minor damage. However, as he hired himself out as a lone gunslinger, the Atlas never quite worked right again and nearly every credit he earned went toward keeping it patched and running. Despite this, Andreou forged a reputation and career as an honorable, if not flashy, warrior.:br:Knight Duncan Kalma: Early in the Jihad, degenerate gambler-turned-Knight Duncan Kalma rescued his father moments before a Blakist team scooped up the former intelligence director. Kalma made his way off world and led a reformed Duncan’s Demons, cobbled together from whatever MechWarriors he could get. The command fought a number of guerrilla actions against Blakists throughout the Free Worlds League over the next several years. An Atlas may not be ideal for such missions, but Duncan made it work, becoming an essential piece of Alys Rousset-Marik’s resistance group. Duncan survived the Jihad but vanished shortly after his father’s death, two weeks after the official proclamation of the Marik-Stewart Commonwealth. His ultimate fate is unknown.:br:Commander Sean Armstrong: Armstrong was formerly chair of Austen-Armstrong Industries’ board of directors. His fortunes slipped away over the course of a financially ruinous decade. The loss of the company’s Bainsville plant to Clan Wolf, followed by the takeover of Abadan by the Clan Protectorate, sent AARMS stocks into a deep downward spiral. The remaining AustenArmstrong directors lost confidence in Armstrong and launched a corporate coup to oust him from his hereditary position. Bereft of his once-formidable salary and now holding worthless investments, Armstrong decided to levy his influential family name as part of a new mercenary venture. His imposing and well-upgraded Atlas was welcomed by every mercenary outfit he approached. Watch agents last spotted him on Galatea making overtures to the rapidly building Bleeding Eagles command.:br:SaKhan Ya’el Labov: In the initial Amaterasu assault on Tahlwynn’s spaceport on Dieron, saKhan Ya’el Labov was injured when her Atlas’ cockpit suffered a glancing blow from a damaged crane. She managed to pilot her ’Mech during the retreat into the mountains, but she was out of action for several weeks as Exarch Damien Redburn led Republic forces and Labov’s own Sea Fox troops against the invaders. Even after she returned to the field, Labov functioned more as an observer. She was often perched above the action in her Atlas for a strategic overview of the battle. During the final push to retake Dieron’s capital, she again entered the fray and proved her skill when she stepped between an Amaterasu Atlas and Damien Redburn’s downed Black Knight. SaKhan Labov made quick work of her foe and saved the Exarch’s life.:br:Representative Rolf Christian Steiner: Rolf Steiner is a hero to the people of Loxley, as a man of royal blood who bends the Estates General to his will. To his peers, however, Steiner is nothing more than a running joke that has yet to run out of breath. Political opponents routinely discover that he is quick to take affront. The representative wastes no time issuing challenges to “fight things out as real Lyrans” at the helm of their ’Mechs. Curiously, Steiner has yet to appear at even one of his so-called duels. His Atlas is always one part away from functionality, forcing Rolf to postpone all his fights. This has done little to whittle his popular base, though. To his supporters, Steiner will doubtlessly prove himself once his Atlas is fully operational. His opponents, meanwhile, openly mock his 1–7 record—his only “win” was the result of the untimely death of his very elderly adversary.:br:Captain Jeremy West: West was born on Ozawa and raised on tales of the exploits of his ancestors. His father regaled him with stories of his Wolf’s Dragoons forebears while his mother, of Nova Cat descent, instilled in him a sense of pride for his heritage. He was swept up by Senator Kev Rosse’s impassioned speeches in the early 3130s. He joined the nascent Spirit Cats, taking on the West surname, and departed for Outreach alongside a small Dragoons contingent. He met warriors from the legendary mercenary command for the first time and found himself torn between his two heritages. It was undeniable by all, however, that the discovery of a sizable cache on Remus was fate’s clear answer for him—he himself stumbled across the battered hulk of the Atlas once piloted by his greatgrandmother, Ariana Foster. West became certain that his future lay with the Dragoons. He departed with them to craft his own legend with the storied command.</notables>
