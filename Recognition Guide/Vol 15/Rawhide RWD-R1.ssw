        <overview>BattleMech aficionado scream-sheets from Solaris VII may have called the Rawhide “a baby Scourge by any other name” and “the Kaiser Cash Grab,” but since leaving the factory floor of Kaiser Systems, the Rawhide has continued to provide solid combat service, proving its detractors wrong.</overview>
        <capabilities>The Rawhide is manufactured with some parts from a failed Scourge prototype, along with a great deal of standard materials for ease of construction and cost reduction. Apart from the AES and armor, the Rawhide lacks many of the advanced components and equipment found on BattleMechs produced by Kaiser’s competitors. Rather than detract from its success, the Rawhide’s construction is actually a battlefield and salesfloor perk, making the Rawhide popular with budget-conscious users like mercenaries.:br::br::tab:The Rawhide’s energy weapons and flexible missile pack befit its rugged construction and allow it to deploy far from supply lines. Versatile weapons, movement, and jump capability put it on par with the vaunted Griffin, a centuries-old Lyran favorite.</capabilities>
        <battlehistory>Born in the crucible of combat, the Rawhide was named for a Scourge test pilot who died valiantly defending the Kaiser factory from an AMSC raid in 3134. From this bloody beginning the Rawhide has seen combat across the Coventry, Arcturan, and Donegal fronts in the hands of Lyran and mercenary MechWarriors alike. The Jade Falcons, in particular, have come to loathe the sight of Rawhides hunting down the Clan’s favored light OmniMechs, such as the Eyrie and Spirit.:br::br::tab:In the Ridesein River Valley on Coventry, the defending Seventeenth Arcturan Guards RCT was pressed to the point of collapse by three Falcon Clusters. With the Lyrans entrenched along the valley’s steep sides, the Falcons were forced to dislodge them with concentrated frontal assaults along the flatter valley floor. Between the first and second wave of Falcon attacks, General Ross ordered a small group of Arcturan ’Mechs, including a Rawhide, to scout the Gyrfalcon Galaxy’s next avenue of attack.:br::br::tab:Moving among the trees and small open fields, the Guards made contact with a Nova of the First Falcon Strikers advancing on the Lyran lines. Cut off from retreat by the swift-moving Falcon ’Mechs, an Arcturan lance relayed the enemy’s position to the Seventeenth and formed a defensive circle. The Lyrans stood their ground as the Falcons charged. Autocannon fire from a Lyran Enfield and Uziel swatted jumping Falcon battlesuits out of the sky, while accurate PPC fire from the Rawhide accounted for a Kit Fox. But it wasn’t enough. Elementals ripped the Uziel pilot from her cockpit, while two Falcon Cougars disemboweled the Enfield with heavy laser fire. The last to fall was the battered Rawhide when a Grand Summoner, armor in tatters, shredded its engine with heavy autocannon fire.:br::br::tab:Deep in the Gray Mountains on the world of Loxley, elements of the Fifth Lyran Regulars engaged Jade Falcons from Gamma Galaxy in a series of running battles for control of the valuable factories. As the battle entered its fifth day, a large Falcon force again attacked the main approach to the Norse-Storm factory. Sensing something amiss in the lackluster Falcon assault, First Leutnant Tim Schoeneck rounded up two battered companies and made for the factory’s hidden entrance in the Peria Canyon. Schoeneck’s command exited the factory and was near the edge of the canyon when the Falcons came pouring in. Commanding from his battered Rawhide, Schoeneck and his troops threw themselves into combat. The dry, desert-like conditions turned the battle into a swirling, dusty melee. The mostly-energy weapon outfitted Falcon OmniMechs suffered while Schoeneck’s Rawhide shone. Its reflective armor deflected even more weapons fire than normal as he waded into close combat with a lone Hatchetman at his side. Schoeneck decapitated a Shadow Cat II with an AES-assisted PPC shot and cored a Pinion with laser fire. The Lyrans won the day when he and two Thunder Hawks collapsed a section of canyon on the last Clan ’Mech, a time-honored way to defeat Jade Falcons.</battlehistory>

        <notables>Hauptmann Kohl von Grunwald: Kohl von Grunwald was on Tharkad for R&amp;R when his Fourteenth Lyran Guards were destroyed by Clan Wolf, so he joined the reformed Seventeenth Arcturan Guards. On Coventry, his company was alone and cut off in the Ridesein River Valley. Kohl and his Rawhide, Cabbage’s Ride, led the Falcons on a merry chase through the valley for three full days until reconnecting with the Seventeenth. During the chase, Cabbage’s Ride accounted for three Falcon ’Mechs, including a brand-new Ion Sparrow.:br::br:Hauptmann Tim Schoeneck: After proving capable of greater responsibilities in his command of the ad-hoc forces on Loxley after other officers had fallen, Schoeneck was promoted and transferred to the Eleventh Lyran Guards. His expertise in combat reconnaissance will serve the Eleventh well in their border defense against the Wolf Empire.</notables>
